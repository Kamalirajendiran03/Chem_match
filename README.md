# Molecular Matcher

Molecular Matcher is a web-based tool designed to analyze and identify drugs based on their Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation. It provides a seamless platform to explore and compare drug structures using SMILES notation.

## Features

- Analyze and compare drug structures using SMILES notation
- Calculate similarity between user-inputted drugs and stored drugs
- Interactive web interface for easy exploration
- Visualize molecular structures with RDKit

## Usage

1. Enter a drug SMILES in the input field on the web interface.
2. Click the "Analyze" button to compare the drug with stored drugs.
3. View the results, including the best-matching drug and similarity percentage.
4. Explore the molecular structure visualization to gain insights.
